# Allrpcs

Allrpcs is a Godot 4.6 .NET game under development. This foundation keeps authoritative rules
in engine-independent C# projects and uses Godot only at the presentation boundary.

## Prerequisites

- A 64-bit .NET 8 SDK.
- The Godot 4.6.3 .NET editor, not the standard editor without C# support.
- `actionlint` 1.7.12 or newer for local GitHub Actions validation.

Both executables must be available to the shell as `dotnet` and `godot`. Verify them before
building:

```sh
dotnet --info
godot --version
```

The verified local versions for this foundation are .NET SDK 8.0.130 and Godot
4.6.3.stable.mono.official. Root `global.json` keeps `dotnet` in the .NET 8.0.1xx feature band
and permits only the latest installed patch in that band. The Godot SDK version is pinned in
`game/Allrpcs.Game.csproj`. To update the toolchain, change these pins and the prerequisite
versions together, then rerun the complete local quality sequence before committing.

## Local quality checks

From the repository root:

```sh
./scripts/quality.sh
```

The sequence restores packages serially, rejects C# formatting drift, builds with current
recommended .NET analysis and compiler warnings treated as errors, runs the domain and
architecture tests, then exercises both headless and 60-frame graphical Godot launches. It
first runs `actionlint` against every hosted workflow. It does not require provider credentials
or network access after restore. The project selects the Compatibility renderer for graphical
launches.

To verify formatting alone without changing files, run:

```sh
dotnet format Allrpcs.sln --no-restore --verify-no-changes
```

The architecture tests inspect authored project files without loading Godot. They enforce the
project-reference directions listed below.

## Credential-free hosted checks

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` configures pull-request and `main` checks on explicit stable runner
images:

- Pure formatting, zero-warning compilation, domain tests, and architecture tests run on
  `ubuntu-24.04` without installing or launching Godot.
- The headless main-scene smoke runs separately on `ubuntu-24.04` with Godot 4.6.3 .NET.
- Unsigned debug exports run natively on `ubuntu-24.04`, Apple Silicon `macos-15`, and
  `windows-2025`. Their targets are Linux x64, macOS Universal 2, and Windows x64.

The workflow grants only `contents: read`, disables checkout credential persistence, defines no
provider inputs or secrets, and uses no dependency cache. Uploaded evidence is named
`UNSIGNED-DEVELOPMENT-*`, retained for seven days, and includes a plain-text limitations
manifest. The macOS job rejects a bundle-level signature and the Windows job rejects an
Authenticode signature before upload. These debug outputs are neither signed releases nor
installers and are not approved for distribution.

Every external action is pinned to a full commit SHA with its verified release tag in a comment:
`actions/checkout` v6.0.2, `actions/setup-dotnet` v6.0.0,
`chickensoft-games/setup-godot` v2.4.2, and `actions/upload-artifact` v7.0.1. Before updating
them, recheck the [supported runner labels][github-runners], action release notes, and Godot
compatibility, update the SHA and tag comment together, then run the complete local quality
sequence.

At this commit the workflow is locally validated but has not run on GitHub-hosted runners. A
successful local lint or export-preset parse must not be reported as live runner or native-build
evidence.

## Unsigned development exports

With Godot 4.6.3 .NET export templates installed, reproduce one CI export locally from the
repository root:

```sh
./scripts/export-development.sh linux-x64
./scripts/export-development.sh macos-universal
./scripts/export-development.sh windows-x64
```

Each command writes only under `artifacts/unsigned-development/`, which Git ignores. The
committed `game/export_presets.cfg` explicitly disables macOS signing and notarization and
Windows code signing. Linux has no signing step. These commands create development-build
evidence only; they do not package, sign, notarize, publish, or distribute the game.

## Launch the empty application

```sh
godot --path game
```

Close the titled **Allrpcs** window to stop the process. To open the project in the editor
instead, run `godot --editor --path game`.

## Project boundaries

- `src/Domain` contains authoritative rules and has no project dependencies.
- `src/Application` coordinates domain use cases and depends only on `Domain`.
- `src/Infrastructure` is the future adapter boundary and depends on `Application`.
- `game` is the Godot presentation project and depends on `Application`.
- `tests/Domain.Tests` tests the pure `Domain` project without loading Godot.
- `tests/Architecture.Tests` enforces these exact references by inspecting project files.

Provider adapters, persistence, gameplay, credentials, signing, installers, and distribution
configuration are not part of this foundation slice.
